# QuantumComputing
This is an implementation of IBM's Quantum Experience in simulation; a 5-qubit quantum computer with a limited set of gates.

It also allows you to execute code printed from the Quantum Composer in IBM's syntax.

Check out any of the test functions for example usage. I'm only part way through the Quantum Experience tutorial, so I will probably have to update this.

Please cite me if you end up using this academically.
