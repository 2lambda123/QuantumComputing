# QuantumComputing
This is an implementation of IBM's Quantum Experience in simulation; a 5-qubit quantum computer with a limited set of gates.

It also allows you to execute code printed from the Quantum Composer in IBM's syntax.

Check out any of the test functions for example usage. All code on the IBM tutorial is tested for and supported.

Please cite me if you end up using this academically.
